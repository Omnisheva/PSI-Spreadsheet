# ðŸ“Š PSI Budgeting Sheet

This spreadsheet was borne out of a desire for me to manage my personal finances while trying to do or avoid certain things like:

* I did not want to pay money for this
* I wanted to avoid pernicious admin and moving imaginary things about the place
* I wanted to create certain types of stats that other systems and apps don't
* I wanted to budget irregular or occasional spending
* Contrary to other budgeting systems I **do** sometimes want to spend money coming in from the future (occasionally and cautiously)
* I did not want to handle over personal details to a third party (this is less of a problem now with Open Banking)

### This New System

As a result the PSI Budgeting Spreadsheet was born. The PSI stands for _Plan, See and Improve_. In a nutshell it revolves around planning your income and outgoings (much like the envelope or zero-based systems), then the tool will work out the budgets for you on your behalf. The seeing aspect is taking that plan and then adapting your spending and saving pattern to suit it. You'd record your spending in the tool and see exactly how close you are to your plan and where you are falling short or doing well. Finally you'd use the information and comparisons to improve either your planning if you're doing well and your goals are on track, or your spending if it shows you're out of whack.

### More About Planning

In other budgeting methods here you'd have a think about your spending, average it up and give yourself a fixed budget on some kind of basis (such as monthly). Not here. Here you tell the tool exactly what your income and spending is going to be like, even if it is irregular. The sheet allows you to do that!&#x20;

From there _the sheet_ then works out your budget telling you how much you need to plan to keep on a monthly basis. You can then use that information to guide how much you put away for every month

### More About Seeing

Having the plan is all well and good but you need to see how you're doing against it. This is where the seeing comes in. You enter your ins and outs into the spreadsheet. Just how much, when and which category. The sheet then develops a load of charts, graphs and stats that you can use to see how well you are doing against your plan and goals.

You'll see (haha) from the tables, charts and graphs you will naturally start challenging yourself to get those downwards trends in the spending charts and to get rid of any red!

### More About Improving

The planning sets the expectations and the seeing shows you the reality. Then it comes to you to decide what needs to change. It could be:

* Nothing. You're completely on track so you just soldier onwards
* Good but you've overestimated some stuff but underestimated other stuff, you can either change your budget if this is reflective of your new ongoing reality or you can just continue on knowing that variation happens month to month
* Bad, you've overspent and you now know you have. Now here unlike other budgeting systems, you wouldn't just temporarily grab money from other categories to save yourself you do one of two things. You either:
  * Accept you have overspent this month and be more actively frugal next month in those categories to pull those averages down
  * Accept this is unavoidably your new reality in which case you plan your budget again giving more money to the categories you have overspent

Ultimately this method minimises any sort of "just for this month" jiggery-pokery and instead focuses you to get better month on month and to rethink your budget if you unavoidably stray from it.

# Seeing Account Statistics

Seeing how much you have on average put into your savings and investments in a period of time is important so there is a sheet that gives you statistics about your accounts. Head on over to the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Account Stats</mark> sheet to see what's happened with your accounts

### The Basics

You are greeted with a big table that details a list of all your accounts. The various columns tell you about:

* <mark style="color:blue;">Account</mark>. The category name for your account
* <mark style="color:blue;">Type</mark>. Whether the account is a savings account or an investment account
* <mark style="color:blue;">Total Paid Into</mark>. How much has been paid into the account
* <mark style="color:blue;">First Date</mark>. The date of the first time you put some money into this category
* <mark style="color:blue;">Last Date</mark>. The most recent date you put some money into this category
* <mark style="color:blue;">Number of Months</mark>. How many month between the two dates
* <mark style="color:blue;">Average Input / Month</mark>. The average amount put into this category every month (including any zeros between First Date and Last Date
* <mark style="color:blue;">Median Input</mark>. This is the middle value of all the amounts you have put into this category (not this is **not** the middle value per month)

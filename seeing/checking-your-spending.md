# Checking Your Spending

Once you start entering your transactions you'll want to see how you are doing against your budgets and see what areas are going according to plan. Head on over to the Spending Stats sheet to see more information about your spending

### Right Most Grey Column

The right most grey column contains some important things that you need to tell the sheet before it starts giving you statistics. The things are:

* Start Period and End Period. You need to tell the spreadsheet between what dates you want statistics for. When looking at stats you may not be interested in things from a decade ago. So enter a starting date in the _Start Period_ box and enter a finish date in the _End Period_ box
* Focused Category. This lets you pick a particular category that you want to zoom in on a bit more

Below this important information are the basic summaries of the spending in that period, as well as any income so you can contextualise it.

### Left Most Table

The left most table goes into some basic statistics for every single one of your spending categories. The columns of the table are:

* <mark style="color:blue;">Total Spend</mark>. The total amount spent in your chosen period for that category
* <mark style="color:blue;">Average / Month</mark>. The average spend for each month within your chosen period for that category
* <mark style="color:blue;">Avg. Item</mark>. The average spend per single transaction within your chosen period for that category
* <mark style="color:blue;">Budget / Month</mark>. This refers to your original budget for that category. It refers specifically to the average budgeted spend per month for that category&#x20;

### Central Charts

The first chart in the centre gives you a visual so you can see in which category you have spent the most money on in your chosen period.

The second chart compares how much you spent each month **for your focused category** and compares it to your exact budget for that particular category.

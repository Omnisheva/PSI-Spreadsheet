# Entering Your Transactions

Transactions are how to tell the spreadsheet what you have actually spend, received and saved over the lifetime of using the sheet. Head over to the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark> sheet where you can enter your transactions

### The Basics

You are greeted with a table with 5 columns you can enter information into. The information you need to enter is as follows:

* The <mark style="color:blue;">Category</mark> column in where you select one of your categories which applies to the transaction you are about to enter
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Type</mark> column is automatically generated and tells you what type of category this is. **Do not overwrite this!**
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Description</mark> column is where you can write an overview of what this transaction is (for example _Gas bill_).
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Date</mark> column is where you can enter the date when this transaction happened
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Amount</mark> column is where you can enter the money amount that relates to this transaction
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Extra Info</mark> column is where you can tell the spreadsheet about some extra key information about the transaction. The current options are:
  * _No Record_. This means that the spreadsheet will not take this into account for computing statistics about this category. **It will take it into account for balances of saving and investment categories however**
  * _A credit category name._ You'll notice you can attach one of your credit categories to a transaction you've already categorised as something else. This is one of the ways you can work with credit cards. See the [Using Credit Cards](../special-how-to/using-credit-cards.md) documentation for more.

### Adding More Rows to Transactions Sheet

**DO NOT** insert rows in the middle of the table. Instead use the add more rows option at the bottom of the sheet if you need to

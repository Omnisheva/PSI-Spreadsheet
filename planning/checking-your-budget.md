# Checking Your Budget

The results of your planning are found on the Budget Summary sheet. Here you'll find all you need to know about your budget as a whole as well as a clearer view on individual budget items.

### Left Most Table

The left most table is a simple summary of your budgets monthly and yearly performance by month and by year. It outlines and averages up your monthly and yearly income and then does the same for your spending.

### Centre Graphs

There are three graphs in this section to help you understand and picture your budget better.&#x20;

#### First Graph

The first of these graphs relates specifically to one particular item in it. You select which item you want to focus on by selecting it from the drop down list.

Once an item is selected the graph will adapt to show you how that particular item from your budget gets spent (or is income). This should be useful for checking whether you have defined the behaviour in the budget correctly

#### Second Graph

The second graph plots your expected income against your expected spending for the whole of the chosen period. Here you can see exactly when your spending will be expected to go above income and you can plan for it (with guidance from the earlier table).

#### Third Graph

The final graph looks at your savings, the remaining difference between your income and spending.  It then tell you how much you have budgeted for each month and then how much will then go into each account (whether that is a saving account or an investment account).

### Right Hand Grey Summary

The summary on the right is arguably the most important information. It summarises key information and tells you overall the most salient bits.

The first part of it gives your total monthly income and total monthly spending and tells you how much you have left each month. If this is highlighted green then your budget is good because you are earning more than you are budgeting to spend. If it is red then it is the other way around and you'll need to rectify that somehow.

The remaining two sections here tell you about your best months, the months with the least expected spend, and the worst months, the months with the most expected spend. This should help you understand when you should expect to have more or less money to hand so you can better plan for it.

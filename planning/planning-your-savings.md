# Planning Your Savings

Once you have successfully planed out your budget, you need to decide what you are doing with any remaining money. The <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Budget Saving Plan</mark> sheet is where you need to go to do this

### The Basics

* The <mark style="color:blue;">Account</mark> column let's you pick a savings or investment category where some or all of your planned money will go into
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Notes</mark> column should have a brief note to say what this is. You might enter something like _Cash ISA_ or _Holiday Fund_.
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Percentage</mark> column tells the spreadsheet what proportion of your planned savings should go into this account. Remember your monthly savings are unlikely to be the same every month so that's why percentage is an option#
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Fixed Amount</mark> column tells the spreadsheet that actually you plan to save a fixed amount every month. Note this could be fundamentally at odds with your planned budget so use with caution.&#x20;

**Note:** If both a percentage and a fixed amount are entered then the percentage will take precedence and the fixed amount will be ignored

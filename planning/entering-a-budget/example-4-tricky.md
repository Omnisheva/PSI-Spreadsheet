# Example 4: Tricky

A difficult one. 16 payments of £50 over a 3 year period only spending money between March and October and not spending any money in the first year of the period

### How To Do It

* We enter some information in the <mark style="color:blue;">Category</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">Description</mark> and column. We shall choose _Spending_ in the <mark style="color:blue;">Type</mark> column.
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Occurrences</mark> column we enter 16. This is the number of times that this item will happen between the dates we are about to enter
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Start Date</mark> column we enter _1 March 2020_ (I could have picked any year). This means the first payment of £50 will be expected in March
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">End Date</mark> column we enter _1 October 2020_ (I could have picked any year). This means the last payment of £50 will be expected in October
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Over X Years</mark> column we enter _3_ because we want this pattern to repeat every 3 years
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Starting Option</mark> column we enter _Start at Year 2_ because we want our monthly payment to not happen in the first year and then to repeat after the 3 year period
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Amount</mark> column we enter _£50_ which is the amount for each instance

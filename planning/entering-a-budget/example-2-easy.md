# Example 2: Easy

For this example we shall create a budget entry that occurs just once but every 2 years, and that £500 spend will be in the first of the 2 years.

### How To Do It

1. We enter some information in the <mark style="color:blue;">Category</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">Description</mark> and column. We shall choose _Spending_ in the <mark style="color:blue;">Type</mark> column.
2. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Occurrences</mark> column we enter 1. This is the number of times that this item will happen between the dates we are about to enter
3. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Start Date</mark> column we enter _1 August 2020_ (I could have picked any year). This means the payment of £500 will be expected in August
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">End Date</mark> column we _leave this blank_ because there is only 1 occurrence
5. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Over X Years</mark> column we enter _2_ because we want this pattern to repeat every 2 years
6. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Starting Option</mark> column we enter _Start at Year 1_ because we want this single payment to be in the first year of the 2 years period
7. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Amount</mark> column we enter _£500_ which is the amount for each instance

# Entering a Budget

Entering a budget is the main thing that makes this spreadsheet work so getting this right is the main priority. Entering budget items that occur monthly or more often that that is pretty straight forward, however those that are less regular require a little more effort. This page is here to help make understanding that process easier. With that said head on over to the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Budget Setup</mark> sheet

### The Basics

* The <mark style="color:blue;">Category</mark> column should say which category this particular item will be coming from
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Description</mark> column should have a brief note to say what this is. You might enter something like _Gas bill_.
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Type</mark> column you'll tell the spreadsheet how often this in or out comes in or out:&#x20;
  * If it is **more** often than monthly then basically pick the most appropriate from the drop down list&#x20;
  * If it is **less** often than monthly then choose Custom
* Some cells may have greyed out depending on your selection, don't worry about filling in a greyed out column for this line
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Occurrences</mark> column should contain how many times this item will spend money between a possible start date and a possible end date
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Start Date</mark> column should contain a date the **first** instance of this item will occur. Only the **day** and the **month** matter, you can enter any year here (so 1847 or 2022, doesn't matter)
* The <mark style="color:blue;">End Date</mark> column should contain a date the **last** instance of this item will occur. Only the **day** and the **month** matter, you can enter any year here (so 1847 or 2022, doesn't matter). Occasionally when there is only 1 occurrence you can leave this blank.
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Over X Years</mark> column determines the number of years that the period between the earlier Start Date and the earlier End Date should be thought over
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Starting Option</mark> column tells the spreadsheet which year it should start or stop counting this item.
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Amount</mark> column tells the spreadsheet the **cost of each instance** <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> of this item

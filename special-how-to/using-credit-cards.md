# Using Credit Cards

Credit cards are an inevitably something you will find yourself using even if it to get that sweet [section 75 protection](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/section75-protect-your-purchases/). So the spreadsheet has the credit account facility just for that purpose. You can theoretically use it for personal loans too but that is a [whole other thing](dealing-with-loans.md). How to use credit cards is below

### On The Categories Sheet

You set up a credit card account like any other category, **however** you **do not** enter anything in the <mark style="color:blue;">Interest Rate</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">Opening Balance</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">Goal Balance</mark> columns. They are greyed out for you anyway.

### On The Transactions Sheet

#### Buying stuff on the card

To buy stuff on the card you would create an entry on the Transactions sheet and attribute it to the credit account you used. See below for an example**:**

#### **Example of buying stuff on the card**

* Assume you have create a _Credit_ category called _Bank Credit Card_
* Assume you just spent £1,000 on a nice holiday

You would now in the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark> sheet put an £1,000 entry in there with the category listed as _Bank Credit Card_

#### Paying off your credit card

In order to pay off your credit card while still being able to track your spending to a particular category you do it in a special way. You create an entry on the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark> sheet for the _spending_ category that it would have been. Additionally though you would in the <mark style="color:blue;">Extra Info</mark> column you would select the _credit_ account that this money would be paying down. See below for an example

#### Example of paying down your credit card

* Assume you have followed the previous example
* Assume you have paid £500 of your credit card bill

You would now in the You would now in the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark> sheet put an £500 entry in there with the category listed as _Holiday_ (or whatever the appropriate spending category would be) and the in the <mark style="color:blue;">Extra Info</mark> column you would enter _Bank Credit Card_

### What Do I Do About Interest?

Interest is annoying since it'll accumulate and it might be a pain to total up and divide it between the spending categories. You have two options here, either the easy way or the hard way.

#### The easy way

Whatever interest has been added to your credit card bill just enter it as if you went out bought it on the credit card. Follow the [Buying stuff on the card ](using-credit-cards.md#buying-stuff-on-the-card)section and put the amount as the interest you've got added to your bill.

#### The hard way

Take whatever the interest figure is and then proportionally divide it between all the spending that you have put on the card and then add it to the figure you record when you are following the [Paying off your credit card ](using-credit-cards.md#paying-off-your-credit-card)instructions **when you pay off that interest**. This is more involved and requires you to do some arithmetic.

# Dealing With Loans

Loans can theoretically be handled by this spreadsheet as well. There are even a few different ways you can do it. Each one has benefits and drawbacks so it's up to you which one you go for.

### Option 1 - Loan as a Credit Account

The first way is to use the loan as if it were a credit card. You setup a _Credit_ category in the normal way and then pretty much follow the [credit card instructions](using-credit-cards.md). Here you would:

* Treat getting the money from the loan person as if you just put something on a credit card
* Treat the regular loan payment as if you are paying down a credit card.

### Option 2 - As a Bizarro Savings Account

The other way is to use the loan as if it was a savings account but with negative opening balance.&#x20;

* Set it up in the Categories sheet as a Savings account
* Set the <mark style="color:blue;">Opening Balance</mark> as the negative of the amount you borrowed
* Set the <mark style="color:blue;">Interest Rate</mark> as the interest rate of the loan
* Set the <mark style="color:blue;">Goal Balance</mark> as 0
* Treat loan payments as if you were saving money into this loan account

### Option 3 - As Just Another Spending Category

This is a straight forward method of simply just creating a _spending_ category something like _My Loan Payment_ for example and then when doing budgeting or transactions just list the loan payment against that _spending_ category

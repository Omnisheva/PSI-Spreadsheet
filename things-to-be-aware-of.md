# Things To Be Aware Of

The spreadsheet is  a Google Sheet so it comes with some of the limitations of that platform. There may be some further development to address some of these issues but some will have to be lived with. The big ones to remember are below

* Using cut and paste, deleting rows or inserting rows is not recommended and can potentially break the spreadsheet. Where you can enter data into it you can already go down to row 999 which should be more than enough for everything except <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark>. For <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Transactions</mark> you can use the **Add More Rows** option at the very bottom of the sheet.&#x20;

* The formulas are pretty sensitive so unless you are confident you know what you are doing, do not edit the formulas as you might break the functionality of the spreadsheet. If you are unsure of which parts of a table you can and can not edit, look at the header colour of that column. If it is <mark style="color:yellow;">yellow</mark> then you can go ahead, if it is grey then you should leave it alone (and even more so if the background colour of the cell itself is blue)

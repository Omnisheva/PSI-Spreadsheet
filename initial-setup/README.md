# Initial Setup

There is a little bit of initial set up to do before you can start using the sheet in earnest. This mainly involves setting up the categories you want to have in the sheet and then setting up your budget. The first thing to do is to set up your categories

### Setting Up Categories

Head on over to the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Categories</mark> sheet. Here you'll tell the spreadsheet what categories you want to separate into. The 5 types of categories are:

* Income. A category for your income. An example might be your monthly salary
* Spending. A category for your spending. An example might be your monthly rent
* Saving. A category that represents a savings account. it could be an actual bank account (for example a cash ISA or it could be a savings goal.
* Investment. Same as a savings category essentially. Separated out in case in future that becomes a more sophisticated investment management aspect to the sheet
* Credit. This represent a credit card like account. It can also be used for something like a loan (see the [Using Credit Cards](../special-how-to/using-credit-cards.md) and [Dealing With Loans](../special-how-to/dealing-with-loans.md) documents)

How to fill out the categories sheet in the [categories document](categories.md)&#x20;

### Setting Up The Planning Stage

Once your categories are set up you can then start entering a budget. Head on over to the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Budget Setup</mark> sheet and you'll see a big table. A comprehensive instruction guide on how to do this is [here](../planning/entering-a-budget/).

When you set up your budget it is over some number of years, like year 1, year 2, etc. you need to tell the spreadsheet what real year (as in 2022 or something) constitutes "Year 1" in your budget. You enter this year on the right hand grey column in the _What Year is Year 1_ white box.

Once the budget is set up you can then decide what you plan to do with your remaining money and tell the spreadsheet with the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Budget Saving Plan</mark> sheet

### Setup Complete

That's the sheet set up. You can go ahead and start recording your transactions as explained in the  [Entering Your Transactions](../seeing/entering-your-transactions.md) document

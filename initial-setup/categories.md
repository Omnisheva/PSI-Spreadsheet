# Categories

Here you'll tell the spreadsheet about the types of income, spending and savings you have. The columns are to be filled out as below:

* The <mark style="color:blue;">Category Name</mark> column should contain a unique name for your category. It might be something like, Monthly Wage for an income or Household Bills for a spend category or Cash ISA for a saving category
* The <mark style="color:blue;">Category Type</mark> column will tell the spreadsheet whether it is an income, spending, saving or investment category. Simply pick from the drop down list. If the rest of the cells on that row suddenly grey out. You're done, move onto the next category you have in mind If not then you've chosen a savings or investment account.&#x20;
* If the rest of the cells are not greyed out then the <mark style="color:blue;">Opening Balance</mark> column enter how much is in this account right now&#x20;
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Interest Rate</mark> column enter the expected interest rate for this account (if not known use some common wisdom)&#x20;
* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Goal Balance</mark> field enter how much money you'd like to have in this account eventually to achieve a personal goal
